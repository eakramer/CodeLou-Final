    <h3>Workshops</h3>
    <p>Reporting on the arts with mulitimedia tools. A sampling of sessions on the schedule.</p>

    <img src="img/Elizabeth Kramer with Chuck Swanson.jpg" alt="Arts Bureau Edge cofounder Elizabeth Kramer interviews gallery owner and artist Chuck Swanson on an iPhone." class="work-img01">

    <p><strong>Basics</strong> — How is the arts journalism? How to pitch stories. How to interview. What does the Louisville area have to offer and how did it come to be like this?</p>

    <p><strong>Media/Mediums</strong>  — Mini-series of workshops working with writing, audio, video and images including photography, illustration and infographics in arts journalism.</p>

    <p><strong>Critic’s Choice V</strong>  — Review an exhibit at a local gallery or museum after a session with curators, artists and writers who present histories about how the media as perceived visual art as it has taken on new forms in the past century and explore the different issues artists address through their work. What makes it significant?</p>

    <p><strong>Critic’s Choice P</strong>  — Review a touring Broadway show: Learn a bit about Broadway’s history, the critics who have held sway over the theater industry as it developed there in the 20th century, how it got where it is today and what goes into a production. Then go to one to see a professional production and give an informed reaction. (The program will cover other performance art forms and organizations.)</p>

    <img src="img/flock of finns 02.jpg" alt="A Louisville public art work, Finns by Marvin Finn at Waterfront Park." class="work-img02">

    <p><strong>Art in Education</strong> — Find where art has a place in education. It can be anywhere: in a preschool to a high school. It could concern the work of a student or a teacher. The story can focus on a person, policy or a piece of art and how it evolved.</p>

    <p><strong>Art in the Neighborhood</strong>  — Find where art thrives and inspires in your corner of the world. That art could be a beautiful statue or just an important sign that people from neighborhoods around it love and find meaning from. This could be a person who has either created a hot spot for artists or is an artist herself or himself and brings pride to the area or teaches there. The possibilities are endless. Think about where art or an artist holds influence, and pitch your idea to one of the instructors.</p>

    <h3>Mission and Contact</h3>

    <p><strong>Arts Bureau Edge</strong> convenes, trains and provides a platform to high school reporters to produce multi-media arts-journalism with the goal of giving them a voice in the metro area and help them become a public resource on the arts for the Louisville region.</p>

    <p>This project comes in March 2018 when the young people are yearning to be heard in the culture and as the practice of arts journalism faces its own obstacles with many media organization making cutbacks to resources for arts coverage.</p>

    <p>"Arts journalism is fighting for its life,” warned American Theatre magazine in April 2017, only three months after a Columbia Journalism Review headline read, "Curtains fall on arts critics at newspapers." </p>

    <p>This project – run by media professionals working with educators – creates opportunities for young people to cover the arts throughout the Louisville metropolitan area and also publishes the arts-related content of existing high school publications.</p>

    <p>Opportunities for participants include weighing in on touring Broadway productions and other theater, music and dance performances as well as art exhibits; profiling artists and arts groups; examining issues related to art and interrelated issues such as public issues such as health, safety, education, the economy and history. But the opportunities also include digging out and producing often hidden stories — those about creative people or events reporters find in their own neighborhoods or even in their own families or historical events long forgotten.</p>

    <p>The founders believe by applying this approach to arts journalism — giving young people the chance to report on the arts and have the community see the world, our daily life and the arts through their eyes — this publication will spark many conversations about art, ideas, issues and the world around us. Furthermore, Arts Bureau Edge aims to allow us to see and include young people more broadly in conversations about art and all the issues that art examines.</p>
